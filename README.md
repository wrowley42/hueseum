We would like to create a web program that takes in a hex code color value from a user and returns paintings from a database that are comprised of that particular (or near) color. If we could get this figured out, we are then able to link paintings to each other by similarity in colors. We could possibly use the Harvard Art Museum API but we plan on using many other publicly available databases of paintings so we have a expansive library with a large scope. This project would serve useful to students who are possibly doing research regarding color (for example, researching color trends across different art eras).
